TODO:

- explore expressions and create preset (filtres...)
- documentation
- supports more than one level hierarchy for signals (ex. /dev1/signal/x)
- possible connection to Zyne synth ? (may have a 'create mapper device' option in Zyne)
- selected/modify connection info (right click, maybe selecting connection line)
- add pure OSC support
- build on Mac
- build on Win
- add menu options for saving/loading
- update to wxpython3
- add a sort of realtime visualization from input/output data (une line simple comme option dans une column, how to insert a line into ctrlList?)
- auto-refresh should list new found devices (hard)
- network interface selection (coded, but doesn't seem to work, needs debug)

Recently DONE:

- update to new mapper API
- save/load state files
- push it to Debian
- add save as / save current menu
- calibrate feature is broken-ish
